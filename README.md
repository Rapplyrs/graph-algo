# Depth First Search (DFS) Alogrithim Visual Display
This is essentially a interactive visual of Depth first Search. This visual display follows the popular Islands and Water algorthim leetcode style question. 
The grid is initially randomized yellow and black cells, where the yellow cells, you can click/interact with to begin the traversal which will transform all connected yellow cells into red cells.  
The purpose of this is to help those better understand how this algorthim works.
